# Power BI Finance Dashboard

**An interactive Power BI dashboard to track income, expenses, and net balance with dynamic slicers for debit and credit transactions.**

---

## Project Overview

This project is a dynamic and interactive finance dashboard built in Power BI to visualize financial transactions. It provides key insights into income, expenses, net balance, and total transaction amounts. Users can interact with slicers to filter by transaction type (debit/credit) and date ranges, while KPIs and charts update automatically to reflect the selected filters.  

The dashboard helps track financial performance, analyze spending trends, and showcase practical Power BI and DAX skills.
